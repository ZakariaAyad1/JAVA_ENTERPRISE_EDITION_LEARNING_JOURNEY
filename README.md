# ðŸ“˜ Introduction to Servlets and How They Work

In web development, when a client (such as a browser) requests a resource from a server, two types of responses are possible:

- **Static pages** â†’ Pre-built content (e.g., plain HTML files).
- **Dynamic pages** â†’ Generated at runtime (e.g., based on user input, database results, etc.).

---

## 1. The Basic Request-Response Cycle

1. The **client** sends a request (e.g., `abc.html`).
2. The **server** checks if it has a static file with that name.  
   - If **yes** â†’ sends it directly back to the client.  
   - If **no** â†’ it must **dynamically generate** the response.  

---

## 2. The Role of the Web Container

The **server** forwards dynamic requests to a **web container** (e.g., **Tomcat**, **GlassFish**, **JBoss**, **WebSphere**).

The web container contains **Servlets**, which are Java classes designed to:

- Accept client requests.  
- Process input data.  
- Generate responses (commonly in **HTML**, but also JSON, XML, plain text, etc.).  

---

## 3. Deployment Descriptor (`web.xml`)

Inside the container, a special file named **`web.xml`** (deployment descriptor) defines **which servlet should handle which request**.

Key elements in `web.xml`:

- `<servlet>` â†’ Defines the servlet class.  
- `<servlet-mapping>` â†’ Links a URL pattern (like `/add`) to that servlet.  

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** If the client requests `abc.html`, the container checks `web.xml` to see which servlet is mapped to that URL.

---

## 4. Writing a Servlet

A servlet is simply a **Java class** that:

- **Extends** `HttpServlet`.  
- **Overrides** methods like `doGet()` or `doPost()` to handle requests.  

**Responsibilities:**

- Receive client request.  
- Process data (e.g., business logic, database queries).  
- Send back a response (usually **HTML**).  

---

## 5. From XML to Annotations (Servlet 3.0+)

- **Older approach** â†’ Mappings defined in `web.xml`.  
- **Modern approach (Servlet 3.0 and above)** â†’ Use **Java annotations** (e.g., `@WebServlet("/add")`).  

This removes the need for XML configuration and simplifies development.  

---

## 6. Quick Recap

- Client sends a request â†’ Server receives it.  
- If **static** â†’ Directly returned.  
- If **dynamic** â†’ Passed to the **web container**.  
- Web container checks `web.xml` or **annotations** â†’ Finds the right **Servlet**.  
- Servlet processes the request â†’ Sends back a **dynamic response**.
